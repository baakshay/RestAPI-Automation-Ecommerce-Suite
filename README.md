# 🛒 E-Commerce API Automation Framework

This repository showcases a professional **End-to-End API Automation Framework** for an E-commerce application. It is built using **Postman**, **Newman**, and integrated with **Jenkins** for CI/CD.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project automates the entire flow of an E-commerce platform, including:
* **User Authentication:** Secure Login and Token generation.
* **Product Management:** Adding and searching for products.
* **Order Lifecycle:** Placing an order, retrieving order details, and deleting orders.
* **Security:** Handling Bearer Token authentication dynamically.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Testing Tool:** Postman
* **CLI Runner:** Newman (for execution without GUI)
* **Scripting:** JavaScript (Postman Sandbox)
* **CI/CD:** Jenkins
* **Reporting:** Newman HTML Extra Reporter

## 🔍 Key Automation Features
* **Token Management:** Automatically extracts the `JWT Token` from the Login API and stores it in collection variables for subsequent requests.
* **Request Chaining:** Seamlessly passes `Product ID` and `Order ID` across different API endpoints.
* **Validation Suite:**
    * **Functional:** Verifies "Login Successfully", "Order Placed Successfully" messages.
    * **Technical:** Status Code (200/201), Response Time, and Header validations.
    * **Schema:** Ensures the JSON response structure is correct.
* **Dynamic Data:** Uses dynamic variables to handle unique order data.
